Sauti Africa Market Prices & API provides an easy to use interface to view and acquire data from Sauti Africa internal databases, and an API which provides JSON responses for developers to use for any purpose.

### Key Features

- Grid Table - ability for non-developer to acquire data from database and download it as CSV
- Documentation - Extensive resource covering features of API and details on the Grid Table
- API - Provides JSON responses via API Key Authentication with usage limits.

## Tech Stack

- State Management done via React Hooks
- Easy to integrate many other third party such ag-Grid, Auth0, etc

#### ag-Grid

- Easy to integrate with React
- Contains easy to implement CSV feature for downloading data
- Draggable columns
- Framework agnostic

#### Cypress

- Comprehensive testing suite for React apps
- Allows E2E testing with Auth0 [read here](https://auth0.com/blog/end-to-end-testing-with-cypress-and-auth0/)
- Allows to test features through third-party libraries as well

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/sauti-africa-market-price-data-be) built using the following Framework & Libraries:

- Node
- Express
- Redis
- Knex
- SQL
- SQLite3
- Postgres
- UUID API key generator
- JWT

# APIs

## Authentication

We use Auth0 for authentication. Auth0 documentation can be found [here](https://auth0.com/docs)

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

- REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TRACKING_ID
- REACT_APP_HOST="localhost:3000"
- REACT_APP_AUDIENCE
- REACT_APP_DOMAIN
- REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID

# Testing

Front-End Testing is done via Cypress.io and Backend Testing is done via supertest

Testing on the front-end requires a `cypress.json` and `cypress.env.json` file with the following information:

`cypress.json`

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "chromeWebSecurity": false,
  "defaultCommandTimeout": 20000
}
```

`cypress.env.json`
(substitute the corresponding values from your auth0 application)

```json

   "auth_audience": "https://my_tenant.auth0.com/api/v2/",
   "auth_url": "https://my_tenant.auth0.com/oauth/token",
   "auth_client_id": "my_client_id",
   "auth_client_secret": "my_client_secret",
   "auth_username": "my_username",
   "auth_password": "my_password"
}
```

Your auth0 application should be configured with _Classic Login_, and _Disable Clickjacking_ should be turned off in _Tenant Settings -> Advanced_. Social login is not supported for testing, only an account registered with email / password.
